      A while loop is a control flow statement that allows to repeat an action or
      code as long as the condition is met. Before each iteration the condition is evaluated
      and executed if the condition is true and stops when the condition is false.
      </p>
    <p>
      "Do While" is similiar to "while" loop with one exception. In "Do While" loop
      the while condition is checked at the end of the iteration, which means that the
      loop is executed at least once.
      </p>

    <p> One example where "Do While" is a better option is a "Guess game". We ask the user to guess
      a number and try to match it with ours. The loop reiterates until and unless the user enters
      the same number as ours. The loop will terminate with the correct guess.
      </p>
    <p>  do {</p>
      <p>  //something you want to execute at least once</p>
      } while (someBooleanCondition);
