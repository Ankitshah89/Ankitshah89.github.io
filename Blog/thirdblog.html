        We use "import java.util.Scanner;" in our code most of the times. So what is it?
        </p>
      <p>
        Scanner is a class in the java.util package which is used to obtain the input of primitive type of
        data like int,double and strings. Its main task is to read the user input data. It is a class
        in the Java API (Application Programming Interface) used to create the Scanner object.
        </p>
      <p>
        Java uses "." to denote hierchy. So java.util.Scanner can be thought as java/util/Scanner in a Java folder.
        We import the Scanner class which is in the util folder which is in the Java main folder. util which stands
        for utility has various other classes and Scanner is a class in util.
