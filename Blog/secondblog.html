        I have had some experience with coding. As an economics major most of my research involved
        statistical analysis. I used R and Eviews for regression and data analysis.</p>

        <p> R is an open source language which means that there are numerous libraries freely available on the web. R is a free
        software which is widely used for statistical and graphical computation. Eviews is mostly GUI
        and does the same work as R but not as robust. </p>

        <p>I have created a few projects using R, the biggest
        one so far is a Recommender system for beer lovers. The application provides recommendation based on a users
        previous preferances; something like what NETFLIX does but on a smaller scale.

        I used the RecommenderLab library from R
        which provides the infractructure  to develop and test recommender algorithms for rating data.
        The package provides basic algorithms to calculate user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
        system among other algorithms. This was a fun project to work and I am planning to upload the interactive
        version of the final product in my personal website by the end of this program.
