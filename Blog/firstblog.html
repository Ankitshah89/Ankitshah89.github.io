      Learning has always been my passion. I am intruiged by the vastness of the information
      available. I am always interested in learning new concepts and methodologies, techniques.
      The main reason behing me joining Skill Distilley is to grow myself as a person. I want
      to be updated with the current trend of techonlogies and utilize the wonders it can do.
      My first blog is a stepping stone towards that goal. I want to start a career in the software
      engineering domain and the skills and knowledge I will gain through the program will be an
      invaluable asset. I want to be a part of a team that creates applications and websites which
      can have an impact in someones life.
